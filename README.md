# ThreeInputCalculator
Create two html files called ‘if-calculator.html’ and ‘switch-calculator.html’ to be used to display your solutions.
Create a js script for each solution and link them into their respective html files.
Inside each script your need to ask the user for 3 inputs and save them to variables
input 1 and 3 will be numbers
input 2 will be an arithmetic operator to serve as the condition/criteria in your control statements
Finally code out logic to perform a calculation using the two number inputs, based on the operator selected by the user in input 2. Add functionality for both the if-statement solution and the switch-statement solution in case the user inputs a character that is not an Arithmetic operator.
Tip: remember, the main condition which determines what functionality will run is input 2 (the operator). The other two inputs are simply operands to be used in the equations/functionality
The results can be logged in the console, be alerted using the alert() function, or it can be printed out into the DOM and displayed on the webpage.
